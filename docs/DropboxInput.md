# Dropbox Input
The dropbox input step reads information from a Dropbox storage account.

### Fields
Field  | Description
------------- | -------------
Send successful transfers to step  |  Successful transfers are sent to this step.
Send failed transfers to step  |  Failed transfers are sent to this step.
Step name  | Specify the unique name of the Dropbox Input step on the canvas.
Access Token  | Dropbox access token. The access token is a string generated by Dropbox to uniquely identify both your app and the end user. Thus, subsequent API calls won't need to transmit the user's Dropbox password.
Source Files  |  Files to be read from Dropbox.
Target Files  |  Target local filesystem locations to write the files.

### Example
In this example, we are downloading a file called 'remoteFile.txt' to our local filesystem, as 'localFile.txt'.
